Abstract
Microbial communities play critical roles in various ecosystems. Despite extensive research on the taxonomic and functional diversity of microbial communities, effective approaches to regulate targeted microbial functions remain limited. Here, we present an innovative methodology that integrates core enzyme identification, protein structural characterization, regulator virtual screening, and functional validation to achieve precise microbiome functional regulation. As a proof of concept, we focused on the regulation of urea decomposition by the rumen microbiota in ruminants. Through metagenomic analysis, we identified the core urease gene and its corresponding microbial genome (MAG257) affiliated with the unclassified Succinivibrionaceae, and reconstructed its complete gene cluster. Structural analysis of the urease catalytic subunit (UreC) via cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed detailed features of its active site, guiding molecular docking studies that identified epiberberine, a natural compound with potent urease inhibitory activity. Validation in a rumen simulation system demonstrated that epiberberine significantly reduced urea decomposition and enhanced nitrogen utilization. This study establishes a robust framework that combines structural biology and computational screening to achieve targeted microbiome functional regulation, offering a promising tool for microbiome engineering and broader applications in animal productivity, human health, environmental improvement, and biotechnology.
